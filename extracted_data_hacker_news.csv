Why not buy good stuff that will last?<p>What are some things you have gotten that are a &quot;great investment&quot; &#x2F; nice buy? IE quality things you use every day or very often that significantly help you &#x2F; make life better &#x2F; easier... Maybe tech related maybe not...<p>For example a few items:
Typematrix keyboard (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typematrix.com&#x2F;)
Use it every day and it makes typing faster and more enjoyable... If it broke I&#x27;d definitely buy another. Though I am considering a mechanical keyboard...<p>Another ergonomic item...
Evoluent mouse (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evoluent.com&#x2F;) 
Nice to use on and off with a standard mouse, though I don&#x27;t like it for gaming...<p>Miracle Rice Cooker (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;miracleexclusives.com&#x2F;miracle-stainless-steel-rice-cooker-p-157.html)
This was such a great investment, I use it frequently and it makes cooking healthy meals simple and easy (it can cook way more than just rice and steamed veggies...) And you&#x27;d be surprised how hard it is to find an actual &quot;stainless steel&quot; rice cooker.<p>Hands free dog walking harness (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;howlingdogalaska.com&#x2F;index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=27&amp;products_id=105)
I have 3 dogs that pull, using a leash like this is a life saver.<p>A couple items I&#x27;m considering....
A &quot;stone&quot; french press since I&#x27;ve broke the last 2 glass ones I&#x27;ve had...

- Good voices and SSML support (we need to customize things quite a bit with &lt;prosody&gt; tags - not sure who else supports that).<p>What kind of players are targeting this space?  Seems like most companies are more focused on texting and very basic voice stuff.",,True,,dy
